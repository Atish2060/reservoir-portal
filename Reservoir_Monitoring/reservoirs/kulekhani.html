                <h2>About Kulekhani Reservoir</h2>
                <p>
                    Kulekhani Reservoir, also known as Indrasarovar, is Nepal’s only reservoir-based hydropower project. Located in Makwanpur District, it plays a crucial role in electricity generation and water management. The reservoir was constructed in 1982 and has a total storage capacity of 85 million cubic meters. It serves as a reliable water storage facility, ensuring sustainable hydropower generation and irrigation throughout the year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike run-of-the-river hydropower projects, Kulekhani acts as a storage-type reservoir, meaning it can regulate water flow based on energy demands. This makes it particularly valuable during dry seasons, when river-based hydropower plants struggle to generate sufficient electricity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from power generation, the reservoir significantly contributes to the local economy, providing irrigation for agriculture, supporting fisheries, and promoting eco-tourism. Surrounded by lush green hills and scenic landscapes, Kulekhani is a popular destination for boating, fishing, and trekking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With its strategic importance in Nepal’s energy sector and its role in environmental conservation, Kulekhani Reservoir remains a vital asset for renewable energy development and sustainable water resource management in the country.
